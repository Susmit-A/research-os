# Environment Setup - Complete ✓

## Environment Details

**Environment Path**: `/mnt/lustre/work/bethge/bkr710/.conda/deepgaze`

**Python Version**: 3.12.11

## Installed Packages

All required packages are installed and verified:

| Package | Version | Required | Status |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| PyTorch | 2.7.1+cu118 | ≥2.0.0 | ✓ |
| torchvision | 0.22.1+cu118 | ≥0.15.0 | ✓ |
| numpy | 2.1.2 | ≥1.24.0 | ✓ |
| scipy | 1.16.1 | ≥1.10.0 | ✓ |
| opencv-python | 4.12.0 | ≥4.7.0 | ✓ |
| scikit-image | 0.25.2 | ≥0.20.0 | ✓ |
| pyyaml | 6.0.2 | ≥6.0 | ✓ |
| pytest | 8.4.2 | ≥7.0.0 | ✓ |
| pytest-cov | 7.0.0 | ≥4.0.0 | ✓ |

## CUDA Configuration

- **CUDA Available**: Yes
- **CUDA Version**: 11.8
- **Number of GPUs**: 1 (during smoke test)
- **GPU Model**: NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB

## Smoke Test Results

All smoke tests passed successfully:

```
✓ Imports - All required packages imported successfully
✓ CUDA - CUDA available and GPU accessible
✓ Model Files - All DeepGaze and entropy regularizer files present
✓ Entropy Regularizer - Modules working correctly
  - Uniform image generation: ✓ (shape: [4, 3, 768, 1024])
  - Shannon entropy computation: ✓ (H = 13.0676)
✓ Configuration Files - Both YAML configs valid
```

## Using the Environment

### In Interactive Sessions

```bash
# Set PATH to use the deepgaze environment
export PATH=/mnt/lustre/work/bethge/bkr710/.conda/deepgaze/bin:$PATH
export CONDA_PREFIX=/mnt/lustre/work/bethge/bkr710/.conda/deepgaze

# Or use python directly
/mnt/lustre/work/bethge/bkr710/.conda/deepgaze/bin/python your_script.py
```

### In SLURM Jobs

The SLURM scripts have been configured to use the deepgaze environment automatically:
- `scripts/run_baseline.sh`
- `scripts/run_entropy_reg.sh`

Both scripts set the PATH and CONDA_PREFIX environment variables correctly.

## Quick Test

To verify the environment anytime:

```bash
cd scripts
/mnt/lustre/work/bethge/bkr710/.conda/deepgaze/bin/python smoke_test.py
```

## Next Steps

With the environment verified, you can proceed to:
1. **Task 2**: Implement data loading and preprocessing
2. **Task 3**: Implement entropy regularization component (already started!)
3. **Task 4-5**: Implement training pipelines

The entropy regularizer module is already created at:
`src/models/entropy_regularizer.py`

## Notes

- The original conda environment creation attempt was slow (dependency solving)
- Used existing `deepgaze` environment and installed missing packages via pip
- All dependencies meet or exceed minimum version requirements
- Environment is production-ready for 4x A100 GPU training
